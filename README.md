# Task-5--Exploratory-Data-Analysis
The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset, as documented in the provided Jupyter Notebook output, led to the following key findings:

Passenger Demographics and Distribution-
The majority of the passengers were between 20 and 40 years old.This was visually confirmed by the distribution of the 'Age' column[cite: 115, 122].

Overall Survival Rate-
The overall survival rate for passengers was below 40%, indicating that the majority of passengers did not survive the disaster[cite: 232].

Key Factors Impacting Survival (Bivariate Analysis)-
The analysis identified two major factors significantly influencing a passenger's chance of survival:
Gender (Sex):Gender had a major impact on survival.Females had a much higher survival rate than males, as shown by the 'Survival Rate by Gender' plot.
Passenger Class (Pclass):Class played a crucial role.3rd class passengers had the lowest survival rate compared to those in higher classes , confirmed by the 'Survival Rate by Passenger Class' plot.

Relationship Between Age and Fare
There was no strong link (or relationship) found between a passenger's age and the fare they paid, as indicated by the scatter plot of 'Age vs Fare'.
